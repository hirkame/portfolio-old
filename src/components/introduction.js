              I played saxophone when I was a high school student and suddenly
              fell in love with JAZZ and FUNK music. I got a shock when I felt
              their groove and rhythm and bass. And I started to be attracted by
              their very origin, ‚ÄúAfrica.‚Äù So, I flied to Kenya, Tanzania and
              Ghana in 2016. And I met some tech entrepreneurs in these
              countries. That is how I got involved in Africa and its tech
              community.
