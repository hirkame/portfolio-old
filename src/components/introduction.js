              I am currently studying sociology at The University of Tokyo and
              working at Progate as the Regional Manager of Africa. Alongside my
              academic studies I do Web/App design, front-end coding, business
              management, and market analysis. As of now I am focused on
              building tech communities in Africa.

            <p>My interest in Africa began via strange circumstances. </p>

              I played the saxophone as a high school student and fell deeply in
              love with JAZZ and FUNK music. I was mesmerized by the groove,
              rhythm and bass. My curiosity led me to digging into the origins
              of the sound, Africa, and in 2016 I traveled to Kenya,Tanzania and
              Ghana. In Africa I met tech entrepreneurs marking the beginning of
              my involvement within the African tech community.
